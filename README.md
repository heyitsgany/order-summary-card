## My process

### What I learned

Working from an external design document and images to produce a finished product which looks and functions as close to the initial design as possible.

Making appropriate decisions in regards to font sizes and weight, element padding, margins. Making sure that the design is responsive and works on a variety
of devices.

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow Generator](https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/box-shadow/) - This helped me for working on the box shadows. Takes some of the guess work out of the properties.
